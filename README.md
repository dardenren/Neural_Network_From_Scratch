# Neural_Network_From_Scratch
*Traditional Neural Network from Scratch*

This was my attempt at creating a traditional feedforward neural network(FNN) from scratch 

The Jupyter Notebook contains a guide on coding an FNN from scratch.

However, the model does not converge well because I was ambitious and implemented many features such as optimization and normalization. 

I intend to work on this project again once I have a solid grasp of higher level mathematics.
